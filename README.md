# Shield Insurance Project

This repository contains the final project for my Data Analyst Internship at AtliQ Technologies. The project involves using Power BI to analyze data for a fictional company, Shield Insurance, to support data-driven decision-making.

## Objective
To enable Shield Insurance to make informed decisions by creating an interactive dashboard that provides easy insights into their data.
